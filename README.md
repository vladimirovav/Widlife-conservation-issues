As a child, I have always felt the best when surrounded by animals, which is why regardless of where I was I managed to always be surrounded by them; whether its feeding stray dogs and cats on the streets, nurturing abandoned hatchlings or following insects. I have continued my passion by completing BSc in Zoology and MSc in Animal Welfare and Conservation and now pursuing a dream of working as a researcher supporting the conservation of wild animals. 

As a researcher, I primarily focused on Animal Behaviour, abundance, distribution and habitat preference. I have gained my main experience by working with wild animals in Costa Rica. I have extensive experience in collaboration through working with locals, governments and international NGOs.
I have conducted multiple studies using various sampling techniques and field equipment which include a rangefinder, GPS, bioacoustics and equipment required to carry out principal component analysis (PCA) for a habitat survey. I have also developed further over the last year is data handling and analysis using various software programs and languages such as R, Minitab and GenStat.
